## Features

### üè† Rental Listings Management (CRUD)
Owners can create, update, and delete rental listings, while users can browse and filter available listings efficiently.

### üîÑ Rental Requests & Transactions (CRUD)
Users can request to rent an item, and owners have the ability to approve or reject rental requests. The system includes a status-tracking feature to monitor transactions.

### üîê Authentication & Authorization
Role-based authentication ensures different levels of access:
- **Admins**: Can manage, edit, and delete listings and transactions.
- **Owners**: Can list items for rent and manage rental requests.
- **Renters**: Can browse listings and submit rental requests.

### ‚ö° REST API
The backend is built using **Node.js (Express) / Django / FastAPI**, providing a RESTful API to handle requests related to listings, rentals, and authentication. The API is fully functional locally, and all data is stored in a local database.

### üõ† Unit and Integration Testing
- **Unit tests** ensure each feature (e.g., rental listing, user authentication) functions correctly.
- **Integration tests** validate smooth interactions between system components.
- **Widget tests** ensure Flutter UI components work as expected.
